## To use the app

To use the app:

1. **Visit the app [here](https://colorado.posit.co/rsc/content/bb3d1bbc-0eb3-4c2d-ac2c-5e8959cf8eaf/).** The app is hosted on [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/), a hosting platform for data driven content. You can use Posit Connect to publish models, reports, etc. securely within your enterprise; or to deploy data products to your customers and manage access.

2. **Select a starting location**. Type in a city name followed by a state, or choose one from the drop down menu. This will be the location you will begin and end your journey at. The app recognizes 312 major North American cities.

3. **Upload a .csv file of destinations** to visit. If you do not have a file, you can download one of the three suggested files and then upload it to the app.

    The file should contain a table that has a column named `latitude` and a column named `longitude`. Latitude, Lat, lat, Longitude, Long, and long are all acceptable spellings. Other columns are OK, but there should at least be a latitude and longitude column. If your table does not have these columns, the app will return this alert.

4. **Select an algorithm.** There are multiple ways to solve the "Traveling Salesperson Problem." The app will use R's [TSP package](https://github.com/mhahsler/TSP)^[Hahsler M, Hornik K (2007). “TSP - Infrastructure for the traveling salesperson problem.” Journal of Statistical Software, 23(2), 1-21. ISSN 1548-7660, doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i02 https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v023.i02.] and whatever algorithm you select to order the destinations into a sensible itinerary.

    After you select an algorithm, the app will build an itinerary and display a Download Itinerary button.

5. **Click Download Itinerary.** The app will download a new version of your file. This versions reorders the rows in your original file to reflect the order in which you should visit the destinations. It also appends a column named "visit order".
